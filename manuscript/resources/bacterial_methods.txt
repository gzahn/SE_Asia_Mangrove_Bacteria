	Samples of Avicennia alba were collected at low tide at seven different sites located across Singapore and Malaysia (map figure). At each site, ten individual and unconnected plant samples free of any visible epiphytes were collected, with each plant sampled at least 10m apart from the previous to prevent possible collection of clones. For each plant, a sterile razor blade was used to obtain leaf, pneumatophores, and fruit samples. Additionally, one sediment sample from approximately 4cm below the surface was collected in close proximity (<1m) to each plant. 
	All tissue and sediment samples were disrupted in an Omni Bead Ruptor 24 (Omni International) at 8m/s for 2 minutes, and DNA was extracted with a Qiagen DNeasy Powersoil kit in adherence to the manufacturer’s instructions. The bacterial and archeal primers 515F and 806R (515F—GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A; 806R—GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT) were used to perform PCR amplification that targeted the V4 region of the 16S SSU rRNA. Illumina adaptors, a linker, and a unique barcode were included in both forward and reverse primers (Caporaso et al. 2011). Each reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 µl, containing 1 µl of undiluted template, 0.1 µl of KAPA 3G Enzyme (Kapa Biosystems, Inc, Wilmington, MA, USA), 0.75 µl of each primer at 10 µM, 12.5 µl KAPA PCR Buffer and water to 25 µl. PCR cycling protocol was 94 oC for 180 s, followed by 35 cycles of 94 oC for 45 s,  50 oC for 60 s and 72 oC for 90 s, with a final extension at 72 oC for 10 min. To identify potential contamination issues, negative extraction and PCR controls were included. 
	PCR products were visualized on a 1% TBE buffer agarose gel. SequelPrep normalisation plates were used to normalise and clean PCR products (Invitrogen, Frederick, Maryland, USA) before being sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (600 cycles, V3 chemistry, 300-bp paired end reads) with a 30% PhiX spike (Macrogen Korea). 
The bioinformatics process involved the removal of adaptors, quality filtering and trimming, error correction, inference of exact sequence variants (ESVs), removal of PhiX and chimeras, and finally taxonomic assignment. Sequences were first demultiplexed by Macrogen, with barcodes and adaptors were removed with Cutadapt (Martin 2011). The DADA2 package (version 1.16.0; Callahan et al. 2016) in R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team 2020) was used in the subsequent steps of the process. Forward reads were truncated at 240 base pairs while reverse reads were truncated at 200 base pairs. Both forward and reverse reads were filtered to remove any reads with a max EE (expected error) or 2, and reads were further truncated with the parameter truncQ = 2 (see https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ for a detailed explanation of filtering parameters). 
The filtered reads were then merged and ASVs inferred from the merged reads using the DADA2 algorithm. Chimeras were removed with de novo detection. The decontam R package alongside sequenced extraction negatives were used to identify possible contaminants (Davis et al. 2017). Any remaining ASVs were assigned taxonomy with the RDP classifier (Cole et al. 2007) against a training set based on the Silva v132 16S  database (Quast et al. 2013).  
	ASVs assigned to mitochondrial or choloropast genomes were removed from further analysis. The Shannon diversity index was calculated for each site and plant structure, and Non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 999 permutations were conducted on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix of samples using the vegan package in R (Oksanen 2019). A Mantel test was used to test for distance decay of similarity using the ade4 package with 999 permutations (Bougeard and Dray 2018). Multiple regression on distance matrices with 9999 permutations using the ecodist package was also used to corroborate results from the Mantel tests (Goslee and Urban 2007). Finally, to identify associations between bacterial species and sites or plant structure, indicspecies analyses were conducted using the indicspecies package (De Caceres and Legendre 2009).
	To visualize overlapping and unique ASVs between plant structures, venn diagrams were generated using the VennDiagram package in R (Chen 2018). A network graph was also plotted to visualize relationships of ASVs between site and plant structures using the phyloseq package (McMurdie and Holmes 2013). All other data visualizations were created using the ggplot package (Wickham 2016).
